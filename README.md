A MVP system for a recruitment system

# 🧩 Internal Recruitment System

An internal web-based recruitment management system designed for small organizations to streamline the hiring workflow — from new job requests to final confirmation.  
This system connects **Recruiters**, **HR**, **Final Confirmers**, and **Admins** in a single, efficient process.

## 🚀 Overview

The Internal Recruitment System helps manage the following workflow:
1. **Recruiter** requests a new job opening.
2. **HR** reviews and approves the request.
3. **HR** uploads candidate information and CVs.
4. **HR** and **Recruiter** collaborate on shortlisting and interview scheduling.
5. **Interview results** are recorded and tracked.
6. **Final Confirmer** reviews the summary and confirms the hire.
7. The system logs all actions for audit purposes.
